Name        : Palindrome validator

Language    : Java
Inputs      : String type (The word needs to be verified)
Returns     : Boolean; true if palindrome else false
Description : Palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
              This algorithm verifies if the received word is palindrome.

Procedure   : In each iteration of the loop, this program matches
              the i th with the {(wordLength-1) - i} th  character.
              
              Let the word is, kayak.
              So when the loop gets executing, for the first i = 0 the
              character will be the first alphabet 'k'.
              So the {(wordLength-1) - i} = {(5-1) - 0} = 4, which is the
              character k from the last. 
              That is how the algorithm matches characters and if any character
              gets unmatched, the boolean turned into false and we know the
              word is not palindrome.
