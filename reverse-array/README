Name        : Reverse an array

Language    : Java
Inputs      : An array (But can be any type)
Returns     : An array
Description : This algorithm reverses the received array and returns the reversed array.
              Insted of cloning the array, this algorithm swaps and interchange values
              on each iteration. For demonstration I've used an array of int. But it can
              be any type. Process will be the same for any type.
